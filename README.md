# Hello, I'm James Strickland! 👋

I'm not your typical software developer, but I love to dabble in various tech-related fields and interests, including:

- **PowerShell Scripting**: I enjoy automating tasks and making life easier with PowerShell.

- **Bash Scripting**: When I'm on Linux, Bash is my go-to for scripting and automation.

- **Database**: I have experience working with databases, handling data, and managing SQL databases.

- **Web Development**: While not my main focus, I've played around with web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

- **Hacking & Security**: I'm fascinated by ethical hacking and cybersecurity practices, always striving to keep systems secure.

- **Making & DIY Projects**: I love getting my hands dirty with hardware and DIY projects, from building custom gadgets to experimenting with Raspberry Pi.

- **Linux & MacOS**: I'm a Linux enthusiast who appreciates the power and flexibility of open-source software, and I'm equally comfortable navigating the world of MacOS.

💡 Fun Fact: I'm always up for learning something new and exploring the tech world beyond my comfort zone.
