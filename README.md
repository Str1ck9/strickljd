# Hello, I'm James Strickland! ðŸ‘‹

I'm not your typical software developer, but I love to dabble in various tech-related fields and interests, including:

- **PowerShell Scripting**: I enjoy automating tasks and making life easier with PowerShell.
- **Bash Scripting**: When I'm on Linux, Bash is my go-to for scripting and automation.
- **Database**: I have experience working with databases, handling data, and managing SQL databases.
- **Web Development**: While not my main focus, I've played around with web development technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Hacking & Security**: I'm fascinated by ethical hacking and cybersecurity practices, always striving to keep systems secure.
- **Making & DIY Projects**: I love getting my hands dirty with hardware and DIY projects, from building custom gadgets to experimenting with Raspberry Pi.
- **Linux & MacOS**: I'm a Linux enthusiast who appreciates the power and flexibility of open-source software, and I'm equally comfortable navigating the world of MacOS.
- **3D Printing**: I'm passionate about 3D printing, exploring the limitless possibilities it offers for creating custom parts, prototypes, and unique designs.
